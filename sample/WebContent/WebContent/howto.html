  <h3>How To</h3>
  <p>
  This project is a culmination of the efforts of Rebecca L, Melissa S, Dang N and Sai R - the below note is a gist of the endeavor.
  
    Our team envisioned this project as an outcome of the findings (refer <a href="inspiration.html">Inspiration</a>) of the  piece "Everybody Lies" wherein it was proposed that even polls(scientific/unscientific) may not reflect how humans truly feel about 
    elections and their internal affiliations or afflictions with a certain candidate. There may be a series of root causes or deterrents that might skew a voter's response while interacting with another human or the knowledge that the person's response might be traceable/tracked. 
    Therefore it was proposed by the author that an unbiased and therefore accurate to a greater degree is the parsing of an anonymous aggregated dataset based on search results that human voters indulge in from the privacy of their personal devices perhaps in an ambient setting that is free from external 
    influences or deterrents. This dataset provides more valuable insight into how people think of candidates(favorably/unfavorably) and piqued interest at various points in time. 
    This dataset is reactive to events that occur real-time (scandals/revelations/declarations) and is a living body of work in a way.
    
    Our project utilizes data points from this fluid dataset to make an assessment of who might be the projected winner in various states of the United States of America pertinent to the 2020 Democratic Primaries as a function of the people's search interest in various candidates.
    The field of candidacy is humungous (as of today in 2019) and we therefore restrict our project to look at 16 candidates that we as a team currently believe are in contention nationally or have sufficient volume in multiple states to also serve the purpose of our project as we track their prospects across the nation over time.
    <br>
    Our project is unique as it will tell you who the projected winner at any point of time that you visit our site is -(refer <a href="index.jsp">Projected Winner</a>). This will change over time based on people's interest.
    We compute based on the field of candidates we are currently tracking(and can be updated based on newer candidates) how many delegates in a state would be allocated to a candidate based on interest distribution.
    The cumulative totals of such delegates are utilized to project a primary victor as of this day(and time)!!
    This project encompasses the candidate's chances based on the pulse of the nation.
    <br>
    <b>Disclaimers:</b>
    Projections made on this site are speculative based on real live data from people performing searches for candidates.
    Projections made may not necessarily translate to actual victory.
    People's searches may not necessarily translate into votes. Searches of the non-voting population are also included in the dataset.
