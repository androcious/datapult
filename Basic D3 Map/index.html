  <h1>2020 Democratic Primary Google Trends</h1>
  <h2>Inspiration</h2>
  <p>In his book, Everybody Lies: Big Data, New Data, and What the Internet Can
    Tell Us About Who We Really Are, Economist Seth Stephens-Davidowitz tells us
    that in the 2016 presidential election, a state’s “search history” for a
    given candidate was a better predictor for a candidate’s success than the
    traditional methods of polling. We think we can leverage this to make a
    unique prediction tool for the 2020 Democratic Primary.</p>
  <p>Polls are historically unreliable in predicting the outcome of an
    election. In the 2016 Presidential Election, every major poll showed
    Hillary Clinton winning the election by a wide margin on the day of the
    election. As we all know, this isn’t quite how things panned out. What if
    we could leverage the public’s everyday search activity to predict an
    election?</p>
